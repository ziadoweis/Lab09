1. main.cpp takes in the amount of nodes, and asks if you want to read a from the SampleMatrix.txt file.

2. The coordinate inputs and outputs in main.cpp are 1-indexed, i.e., an input of addEdge(1,2) would add an edge at
   Row 1 (first row in matrix), Col 2 (second column in matrix).

3. The professor said it was fine that we don't have a way to test DFS and BFS in main.cpp, since it wasn't
   explicitly stated in the instructions. They are, however, tested in tests.cpp

4. For tests.cpp, cd into the /build directory and run ./runTests

5. Just in case it gets overridden by accident, here's the sample matrix from the input file:

0010000000
1000000000
0101100100
0000100100
0000001000
0001000000
0000010000
0000000011
0000000001
1010000000
